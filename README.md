# Food Redistribution System

A console-based C++ application that connects food donors with recipient organizations (hospitals, old-age homes, and charities), matching available donations against incoming requests and routing deliveries across a simulated city road network.

The system was built to explore core data structures and algorithms in a practical, real-world scenario rather than in isolation — every DSA concept below maps to an actual operational need in the system (e.g. urgent requests need a priority queue, not just a list; route calculation needs a weighted graph and Dijkstra's algorithm, not a lookup table).

## Overview

Donors register and log food donations with quantity and expiry information. Recipient organizations submit requests for specific food types and quantities. The system automatically matches requests to available donations — prioritizing by organization type (hospitals first, then old-age homes, then charities) — and calculates the shortest delivery route between the donor's and recipient's locations using a custom-built graph of Karachi neighborhoods.

Requests that cannot be immediately fulfilled (due to insufficient stock, expired donations, or unavailable food types) are moved to a pending queue with a logged reason, and can be edited and resubmitted later.

## Features

- **Donor management** — add, search, list, and remove donors (individuals or organizations)
- **Donation tracking** — log donations with food type, quantity, and expiry date; automatically purge expired stock
- **Request handling** — submit requests that are auto-prioritized by organization type (Hospital > Old-Age Home > Charity)
- **Automated matching** — matches pending requests against available donations by food type, quantity, and expiry validity
- **Pending request recovery** — failed matches are queued with a specific failure reason (out of stock, insufficient quantity, expired, donation already used) and can be rebooked with updated details
- **Delivery routing** — computes the shortest path between donor and recipient locations across a 15-location city map
- **Reporting** — fulfilled delivery history and live system statistics (urgent/pending/delivered counts, donor breakdowns)
- **Persistent storage** — donors, donations, and all three request queues are saved to and reloaded from CSV files between sessions

## Data Structures & Algorithms

| Concept | Where it's used | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Priority Queue (binary heap)** | Urgent request queue, Dijkstra's frontier | Requests need to be served by priority (hospitals before charities), not insertion order |
| **Queue** | Pending requests | Requests wait to be retried in the order they failed |
| **Stack** | Fulfilled request history | Most recently delivered requests are naturally shown first |
| **Singly linked list** | Donor records, donation records | Supports dynamic insertion/removal without pre-sized storage |
| **Weighted graph (adjacency list)** | City road network | Models real distances between 15 Karachi locations |
| **Dijkstra's algorithm** | Shortest delivery route | Reused the project's own max-heap `PriorityQueue` (negated distances) instead of pulling in a separate min-heap implementation |

All core structures (`Stack<T>`, `Queue<T>`, `PriorityQueue<T>`, `Graph<T>`, linked lists) are implemented from scratch as templates rather than relying on the STL equivalents, since the point of the project was to build and reason about the structures directly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows (the project uses `<Windows.h>` and `system("cls")` for console handling)
- Visual Studio (recommended — a `.sln` file is included) or any MSVC/MinGW-compatible C++ compiler

### Build & Run

1. Open `FoodRedistributionSystem(new).sln` in Visual Studio
2. **Important:** `redistribution.cpp` should **not** be compiled as a separate translation unit — it's already pulled in via `#include "redistribution.cpp"` at the bottom of `Redistribution.hpp`. If your compiler complains about duplicate symbols, exclude `redistribution.cpp` from the build (right-click the file → Properties → Exclude From Build → Yes).
3. Build and run `FoodRedistributionSystem.cpp` as the startup project.
4. On first run, the app creates its own CSV files (`donors.csv`, `donations.csv`, `pending.csv`, `urgent.csv`, `fulfilled_request.csv`) in the working directory to persist data across sessions.

## Sample Flow

1. Add a donor and log a donation (food type, quantity, expiry date).
2. Submit a request from a recipient organization — it's automatically ranked by priority.
3. Run **Fulfill Urgent Requests** — the system matches it against available donations and prints the shortest route from the donor's location to the recipient's.
4. Unmatched requests fall into the pending queue with a clear reason, and can be edited and rebooked later.

## Web Edition

The same engine is also available behind a small local JSON API (`ConsoleApp` → `WebEdition`), driving a web dashboard — donor/donation management, request submission, live fulfillment runs, and an interactive graph view of the routing network with the actual Dijkstra path highlighted. See `WebEdition/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. This runs as a second, independent executable; the original console app is unchanged.

## Notes

- Location data (donor/recipient addresses) is currently limited to a fixed set of 15 predefined Karachi neighborhoods used in the UI. The underlying road graph technically has a 16th node (`Gulistan-e-Jauhar`), added implicitly as a waypoint between two of the listed locations, but it's never assignable as a donor/recipient address.
- Matching logic checks food type, available quantity, donation status, and expiry date (relative to the request date) before confirming a fulfillment.
